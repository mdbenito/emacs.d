# My emacs config

* Heavily based on [Daniel Higginbotham's](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d) config.
* Seriously bloated.
* Consistently inconsistent key bindings.
* I probably added lots of silly mistakes.
* You should probably look elsewhere for inspiration.

# To do

* Make links in stack traces (pdb) clickable.
